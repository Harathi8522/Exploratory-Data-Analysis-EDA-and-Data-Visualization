# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-and-Data-Visualization
In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on a structured dataset using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. I cleaned the data, explored feature distributions, analyzed correlations, and visualized key insights through charts and plots â€” gaining a deeper understanding of how to extract meaning from raw data.
