## ✨ Overview

This project is a hands-on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** journey where I dive deep into a dataset, ask meaningful questions, and extract real, actionable insights using Python tools. It’s not just about graphs — it’s about stories hidden in data.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> “What are the key factors influencing the outcomes in this dataset?”  
This project aims to understand **feature relationships**, detect **patterns or outliers**, and derive insights that could help in **predictive modeling** or **decision making**.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights & Learnings

✅ Found strong correlations between features  
✅ Identified potential outliers affecting performance  
✅ Used heatmaps, boxplots, and distribution plots to understand spread and skewness  
✅ Cleaned missing values and standardized formats  
✅ Learned the importance of asking good *data-driven questions*
